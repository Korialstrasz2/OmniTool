# OmniTool

A small web interface to launch personal scripts and tools.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:5000` in a browser.

On Windows, you can double-click `start.bat` to install dependencies, run the server, and open the app automatically.

## Adding tools

1. Drop your executable scripts into the `scripts/` directory.
2. Add an entry to `tools.json` with the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Display name",
  "description": "What the tool does",
  "command": "script_or_command_to_run"
}
```

The command is run from the `scripts/` directory, so relative paths work.
Each tool automatically gets its own page with a "Run" button.
